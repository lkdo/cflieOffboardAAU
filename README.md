# cflieOffboardAAU

Implements a simple external/offboard position control loop for the Crazyflie, based on positioning data from a socket connection (tested with the GamesOnTrack experimental positioninhg system). 

Code meant to compile on the Windows platform.

ToDo: CMake for Windows

Dependenies: libcflieAAU (https://github.com/lkdo/libcflieAAU), libusb-1.0 https://github.com/libusb/libusb) 
       
Meant to be useful when starting working with the Crazyflie, at Aalborg University Automation & Control Lab.
